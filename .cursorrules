You are working in the Eclair repository - an Image-to-Video generation subnet.

# Project Structure
- eclair.py: Main validator script (single file, ~890 lines)
- knowledge/: Bittensor subnet knowledge base
- hiptest.py: Development/testing script for the I2V pipeline

# Key Components
- Sample Generation Loop: Downloads videos from Hippius, generates I2V, scores with GPT-4o
- Weight Setting Loop: Reads samples from bucket, calculates win rates, sets weights
- Storage: Hippius S3 (lot-of-videos source, video-samples output)

# Environment Variables (see env.example)
- CHUTES_API_KEY: For I2V generation
- OPENAI_API_KEY: For GPT-4o evaluation
- HIPPIUS_SEED_PHRASE: For S3 access

# All Bittensor subnet knowledge is in @knowledge/
# Start with @knowledge/INDEX.yaml for task routing
