# Bittensor Subnet Development: Complete Guide

This comprehensive documentation provides everything needed to understand, create, and operate a Bittensor subnet. It synthesizes information from multiple sources and real-world production mechanisms.

## What This Documentation Covers

This guide is designed for LLMs and developers who need to:
- Understand Bittensor's architecture and incentive model
- Design effective incentive mechanisms
- Implement miners and validators using appropriate patterns
- Deploy and operate subnets on localnet, testnet, and mainnet

## Key Insights

### Mechanism Architecture Diversity

**The Axon/Dendrite/Synapse pattern is deprecated.** New subnets should always use open source, custom communication methods. Document 04 covers the recommended patterns used in production:

- **HTTP/REST APIs** with Epistula signed headers (Targon, Chutes)
- **External data sources** validated on-chain (Gittensor, Data Universe)
- **Compute marketplaces** with attestation (Targon, Chutes)
- **Forecast/prediction markets** (Synth, Zeus)
- **Data scraping/indexing** with periodic validation (Data Universe)

Miners commit connection info to chain (API endpoints, S3 URLs, database endpoints). Validators read this to discover how to communicate with miners.

### Sybil Resistance Reality

**Coldkeys are NOT sybil-proof.** The actual sybil protection in Bittensor is:
- **256 UID slots per subnet** with **dynamic registration costs**
- When expected rewards increase, registration costs rise automatically
- This creates economic equilibrium preventing pure sybil farming
- "UID pressure" = demand for slots = registration cost

### Subnet Design Philosophy

**Keep subnets minimal.** Focus on the validator (the "referee"), leave ingenuity to miners.
- Few files, not dozens
- Clear, auditable scoring criteria
- Validators define "what is valuable"; miners compete to provide it

**NEVER write miner code.** See [15-validator-only-development.md](15-validator-only-development.md) for the full rule:
- Only write `validator.py` - miners read it to understand the interface
- Define where you look for inputs, how you evaluate, what you score
- Miners implement their own solutions based on your specification
- Single-file validators are easier to audit, understand, and maintain

### Hyperparameter Reality

**Not all hyperparameters are changeable** even though they appear in docs:
- `tempo` - NOT changeable
- `max_allowed_uids` - NOT changeable
- Don't use commit-reveal unless absolutely necessary (weight copying is a mature subnet problem)

Choose your architecture based on your commodity type, not by copying a template.

## Quick Start Paths

### "I want to understand Bittensor"
Start with documents 01-03

### "I want to design a subnet mechanism"
Read documents 01-04, then 08

### "I want to implement a miner"
Read documents 02-04, then 06

### "I want to implement a validator"
Read documents 02-04, then 07-08

### "I want to deploy to mainnet"
Read documents 05, 10-11, then 13-14

### "I want to build a subnet"
Read document 17 first (what am I measuring?), then 15 (validator-only rule), then 04, 07-08

### "How do I make a subnet with this repository?"
Read document 16 for the complete step-by-step walkthrough
